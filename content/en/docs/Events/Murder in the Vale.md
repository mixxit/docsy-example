The Adventurers continue their search for the Earthbreaker

# Event Notes

The Aerindal 

Strange Aerindal, needed a place to stay, stayed for one week, two nights ago went missing not long after another stranger took a room

## THE FADED

A fairy, one of the faded, came to stay two nights ago, never saw either of them again

## THE ROOM

It looks like there was a struggle

The room is covered in blood and items are thrown about

If the room is searched

a box of dwarvish design appears to be underneith the bed, it is open and has the a symbol with the words Clan Ironfist written in a circle in what looks to be deep tongue

A prayer book to Aer'Aral, two pages are ripped out of the middle, there are scribbles down the left and write of the passages, you do not recognise the tongue

## THE OTHERS ROOM

The room is well kept, there are some coins on the dresser but nothing of note

## THE BODY

The body is that of a faded, fairy.

## If the body is searched: 

* A note, it is very soggy, if words can be made out it seems to have been written by the Lord of the Summit

* A Faded's Dagger

## Enchanter Yumi

Yes i saw him, but i dont want trouble

He wasnt a fairy, and he wasnt an Aerindal, i know that much. He was... something else

## Sir Windstrom

the stranger came to the church yeah, he looked worried, i think he felt some people were after him or something

He stayed for hours and prayed but kept looking over his shoulder, it was weird, that night the weather was like none other id ever seen, we closed the doors when the  storm came but he insisted to leave, its like he had prayed for it or something

## Arcanist Faerrift

There was a storm, i was closing up when i saw some hooeded man heading east into the heart of it, i thought hes crazy, but he looked adament, he just headed out east god knows where, hope hes ok

## THE TRACKS

You find some tracks, they have dried in the sun and seem to be heading in the direction of east

At the end of hte tracks you find a piece of paper, it is a page from the Prayer Book of Aer'Aral,


it is a tale about a mysterious man who should not be

it talks about a special door that went through and dissapeared forever

there is a crewdly hand drawn map on the back of the page, it seems to be at the other side of the lake

## THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE

You find a tree with a rectangular shaped burn in it, about the size of a door, it is hot to the touch

## Barkeep Shromna

He never drank, kept himself to himself, seemed to always be carrying something

Vocalist Dialmo

I was singing that night lots of people were here but i could hear banging on teh walls, something was happening upstairs, i think a commotion, someone came downstairs, they didnt look so healthy, they were in a rush, not sure where they went

About 30 minutes later someone else came, hooded, they looked to be in a hurry, they went towards the church

[LMNDEFWIZ]~Estrela: Did you investigate?  [DARKELF]

* Estrela says something under her breath in under tongue 
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: Me could ask spiritz, but ... busy with many things ... [ORC]
[LMNDEFWIZ]~Estrela: Did you not come to an understanding with Lady Xuul? Your life for this, very high priority task  [DARKELF]

[LMNLIDSHM]~Valdez the Vipers Bane: can you give me a brief summary of what was this meeting about? [LIDKIM]
* One_Eye mutters to himself about how to duplicate that trick with the teaching of a language. You hear him say something about hitting someone over the head with a rock that has orcish writing on it. 
[LMNDEFWIZ]~Estrela: it is a private matter between Drithis and those involved, what makes you so inquisitive on such matters  [DARKELF]
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: This one look fresh from swamp. Not learn talky much. [ORC]
* Ferox_Ragash chuckles to herself about One Eye's language teaching methods 
[LMNLIDSHM]~Valdez the Vipers Bane: i'm sorry for suddenly eavesdropping on your earlier conversation, i kinda got thrown away for home and they said i should only come back when i was any good as a shaman for my village [LIDKIM]
[LMNLIDSHM]~Valdez the Vipers Bane: so i've been venturing while learning magic [LIDKIM]
[LMNDEFWIZ]~Estrela: Dear, i am not sure if you are aware, but I spend my life selling your kind into slavery  [DARKELF]
* One_Eye looks to Valdez at those words and feel suddenly inclined toward the odd fellow. 
[LMNLIDSHM]~Valdez the Vipers Bane: and i thought a dark elf and a dragon could've been good teachers [LIDKIM]
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: That worked so gud for you when you sell us. [ORC]
[LMNLIDSHM]~Valdez the Vipers Bane: i... [LIDKIM]
* Estrela glares 'If i report back to the Lady now i am sure it can be re-arranged orc!' 
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: You no have Lidkim shaman teacher? [LIDKIM]
[LMNLIDSHM]~Valdez the Vipers Bane: no... [LIDKIM]

* Estrela chuckles 
[LMNLIDSHM]~Valdez the Vipers Bane: oh... [LIDKIM]
* One_Eye grabs his head as if struck by a headache. It looks kind of adorable since he is a bear. 
[LMNDEFWIZ]~Estrela: Fine, whatever, you are responsible for him  [DARKELF]
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: Valdez, you now me teachy teach. [LIDKIM]
[LMNDEFWIZ]~Estrela: If he breathes a word of what we are searching for, on your head be it  [DARKELF]
* One_Eye farts. 
* Estrela flicks through her spellbook aggressively, 'Right, the Vale' - she moans at the thought of nature 
* Ailin_Darkashe chuckles 
* Ferox_Ragash chuckles 
* Valdez sorry, mister orc looks like i've put you into some trouble 
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: iz ok. Shaman work together [LIDKIM]
* One_Eye shifts back into his orc form since he is now in an orcish town 
* Valdez waits patiently for the orc 
[LMNDEFWIZ]~Estrela: So, I have got you this far, Aerindal - last seen heading into this vale. Now its down to you  [DARKELF]
* One_Eye hands valdez a sheaf of papers written in his own hand. It is a sort of training course on how to speak orcish. It mostly deals with insults, swear words, and trading 
[LMNLIDSHM]~Valdez the Vipers Bane: thank you mister [LIDKIM]
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: you talk in orcy now [ORC]

[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: Today we look for Airy Doll named .... uh ... Raw Urn ... [ORC]
* Ferox_Ragash furrows her brows, but does not ask any questions 
* Ailin_Darkashe chuckles hearing that and mutters "later eh" 
* One_Eye grins and thinks of that last token he keeps in his pocket. The thing Darlan has been seeking for so long. 
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: Uh .... this not so good .... [ORC]
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: You talky angry elf talk? [ORC]

* Ferox_Ragash perks up, concern growing on her face 
* One_Eye sighs expansively 
* One_Eye braces himself as if expecting some pain and then says .... 
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: If you would not mind, good sir. We are a traveling group looking for a lost member of our cohort. We seek an Aerindal named Ra'Ern. Perchance have you come across such an elf in your travels? [DARKELF]

[LFNGIAROG]~Ailin_Darkashe the Shade of the Depraved: what is that horrible thing?)) [MEROEI]
* One_Eye looks confused. "A beard?" 
* One_Eye nods. "Uh huh. Yes. Some day. We do that." 
* One_Eye turns and leaves.
