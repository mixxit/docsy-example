LADY XUUL

I will be brief, as my time is limited and quite frankly you are not worth a moment of it. However, we align our interests with Yarik on a matter involving all of you

Now, I see you here, in my prison. I am wondering to myself why oh why would an esteemed member of The Company choose you for such an important task?

Perhaps it is a lack of focus, you are not... taking the matter seriously enough

Perhaps I can give you some focus, yes? 

The Earthbreaker was an artifact created to pierce a hole from one plane into the next, it was once held be a certain Keladun [ Brendl Ironfist ] in the Under and then, after an unfortunate accident, by us

For a time, it was with Ra'Ern in The Great Library but it went missing. Not so long after the Caerthians began a campaign against our kin 

We have searched for it ever since, we have our suspisions it was one of our own, who else could get access to the library we thought? Well, it seems Ra'Ern may not be such a great arcanist as he thinks. We found an illusionary door on the third floor of the library which led all the way out of Undergate, the Keladun dont care much for illusionary magic, and nor did the druids of Olvasound. We suspect it was an Aerindal

Considering the invasion and the fall of the Aerindal city of Eindel, we believe the Aerindal Enchanter is here somewhere among the Severed Isles, no doubt in hiding in Utra, considering your influence there I imagine this is why Yarik chose you

Now, what to do with you...

I could have you sent to the brothels of course, have you shredded, one by one, by the mistresses of pain

Or I can let you free, and trust Yarik knows what he is doing. Hmm.... 

Yes, perhaps I will give you one more chance

Once we have dealt with the riots, Drithis is at your disposal, now I must return to the palace
