# Event Overview

Duke Vorndin tells the group his plans are nearing fruition. He has his own people dealing with patrols farther away from Ezro. The patrols consist of one or two Anushi plus several Bullywug warriors. He instructs the party to deal with the patrols closest to Ezro so that his own people are not spotted. He prefers the patrols are simply killed, but doesn't really care how they are handled as long as they are absent for the foreseeable future. 

The party goes to Ezro and sees the first patrol. The party is somewhat undecided on preferred tactics but the choice is made for them as the masked and cloaked Fran approaches and is attacked on sight. The party eliminates the first patrol with no losses.

At this point the party splits up. Fran goes off on her own and the remaining party members track  down the next patrol. This next patrol has a pair of Anushi Citizens with them. This caused more disagreement on how to handle the situation. The party engages the patrol and is wiped, though they manage to take out all but one Bullywug in that patrol. The unconscious bodies of the party (except for Fran) are taken into the Hall of Elders in Ezro. The patrol that Fran was following is called into Ezro by a warning bell and Fran tracks them into the city. She ends up sneaking into the Hall to watch things unfold.

The party is interrogated at length by the Elders. They manage to dissemble sufficiently to cloud the truth in half truths and lies. The Elders are close to just letting everyone go because they have a war to worry about. That is when Fran (in a new disguise) reveals herself. She throws the party under the proverbial bus. She ends up trying to convince the Elders that the party is working with an Undead Duke. Ferox is allowed to go to Orc Watch to get the Egg Warmer she has stashed there to prove they are enemies of the Kenku. She arrives back as Fran is using her Backstab the Party skill. 

The Eldersare presented with actual proof that they are aiding the war effort against the Kenkus, but their story still does not smell right. Combine that with the information coming from Fran and the Elders simply cannot let any of them go. They can tell they have stumbled on something larger than themselves and they are too busy fighting a war to handle an inquiry. They decide to send the problem up the chain to the Tanqarans. They plan to send the party to Tanqara using Denko as guards. 

As part of sending the party away the Elders insist on Marking each of the party, including Fran. They refer to the mark as the Mark of Villainy. It is applied magically. The Elder drags their claws across the forehead of the victim using some sort of spell that heals the wound into scar tissue. It was explained out of game that anyone bearing the mark will be viewed as untrustworthy by any Anushi that sees the mark. If the mark is not visible then any nearby Anushi will feel uneasy around the person in question. The mark can be removed by an Elder or a leader in Tanqara. The entire party accepts their marks except for Scinthia the Dark Elf Necromancer. 

When the party resists the Elders had finally had enough. They decide to kill everyone and send the bodies to Tanqara for resurrection and judgement. Most of the party escapes using a wizard teleport spell and Fran escapes using guile. 

The party reports back to the Duke. He is furious. He exiles the party from his presence. He states they are not welcome back to his presence unless the party can prove themselves useful. 

Ferox asks to speak with Vorndin privately. She appeals to him to be able to see Maalrin, the prisoner. He agrees and she goes to see the Mysmaal in the jail. He is nearing death from starvation. She cuts open her hand and lets him feed from her. The pair have a tender moment and she promises to help him.
