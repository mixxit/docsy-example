Duke_Vorndin says 'Nobility is leadership. That is why I and my fellow leaders of the Undead have taken the title of Duke . That is why we each seek a stronghold for our people. That is why whichever of the Dukes succeeds will become King of all Undead.' [Undead] 
 
Duke_Vorndin says 'Is that sufficiently noble for your tastes?' [Undead] 
 
Duke_Vorndin says 'Well?' [Undead] 
 
[LMNDEFWIZ]~Duradae_Olath the Bloodletter: and i respect you for wanting to take care of your kind, i just want to make it clear that as soon as i think you start going down an evil path against the other inhabitaints of this land i will not hesitate to stop you [UNDEAD]

C>[LMNDEFWIZ]~Duradae_Olath the Bloodletter: let me put my proposition this way duke. i will help you, i will kill for you, as long as i think they deserve it. but if you ask me to kill those i am on good terms with then our alience will end. i do not know what the rest of my companions will chose [UNDEAD] 
 
C>[LMNDEFWIZ]~Duradae_Olath the Bloodletter: but that is my proposition [UNDEAD] 
 
 * Duradae_Olath leans back while studying the duke 
 
 * Scinthia_NReth stamps on durades foot to try to silence him 'I think the duke is well aware of your opinions' she points towards the hulking figures unsheathed blade  
  
Duke_Vorndin says '"Do not be mistaken. This ... is ... a war. All those that inhabit this forest must go. If you choose to side with them then you will no longer be welcome amongst my people. Decide for yourselves, but decide soon. Within the next three days."' [Undead]

 * Scinthia_NReth squints at duradae  
 
 * Duradae_Olath looks like he is about to say some thing, then looks at scinthia and falls silent, grumbling under his breath  
 
That is not a valid sub command, see /event 
 
 * Scinthia_NReth looks quite content with herself  
 
Duke_Vorndin says 'My first task for you is to learn the lay of the land. Its people, their numbers and disposition. I wish my intelligence to be up to date.' [Undead] 
 
 * Ferox_Ragash nods approvingly at Scinthia, then looks back to the Duke  
 
[LMNORCSHM]~One_Eye the Chieftain: ((this is a task that won't happen during sessions. [UNDEAD] 
 
 * Duradae_Olath glares at scinthia, trys to decide whether or not to strike her with lightning
