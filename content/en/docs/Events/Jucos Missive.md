2019:|Father_Branan rolls out a map and plots his finger across it
2019:|Father_Branan looks into his book and mutters a prayer to Enruel
2019:|Ray looks around the tavern watching carefully at the people inside
2019:|Reggie_Luthier sings a song in anushi about the heroic deeds of the late Prince. After a few minutes the other bard on stage starts arguing with Reggie about the lyrics not being respectful. The other anushi in the tavern start eyeing Reggie with mild hostility.
2019:|Reggie_Luthier frowns at the other bard, realizing the general feeling has turned against him. He steps off the stage and orders a drink.
2019:|Reggie_Luthier eyes Belle lasciviously.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Hello there, sweet face.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Your hair is like the softest clouds in a morning breeze.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: What sort of beverage does one as lovely as you drink?
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: My name is Reggie, by the way.
2019:|Reggie_Luthier continues trying to flirt with Belle to no avail.
2019:|Ray looks at the bard and chuckles then silently casts on him a spell
2019:|Father_Branan looks over and tuts then gets up and heads to the bathroom
2019:~Ray: The barkeeps and all the people seeing her or near her notice her casting
2019:~Father_Branan: is there no restroom in this tavern?
2019:|Syvis takes a sip from the bottle of wine and looks at the wood of the bar not payining any attention to the people around her
2019:|Father_Branan leans on the counter and sighs, tapping his fingers at the barmaid who appears to be ignoring him
2019:|Reggie_Luthier looks at the anushi bard with slight annoyance.
2019:|Reggie_Luthier mumbles something about his song being better.
2019:|Reggie_Luthier finishes his wine then heads back to the bar
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Another wine, if you please.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Thank you, good sir.
2019:|Ray looks at the barmaid and with a charming smile asks for a bottle of wine
2019:|Father_Branan turns his head to the bard on stage
2019:|Syvis takes another sip from her wine and starts looking at the people in the tavern
2019:|Father_Branan closes his eyes in silent prayer
2019:|Reggie_Luthier mutters, "Hmmm, that was actually pretty good. Could use a drum rhythm to sound like war drums though."
2019:|Reggie_Luthier looks down to his decidedly non furry skin and chuckles once.
2019:|Syvis lets her eyes rest on the bard and decides to observe him for a bit
2019:|Father_Branan turns to flip through the newspaper rag on the bar, oblivious of recent events
2019:|Ray hears at the bard with attention
2019:|Father_Branan looks up, hearing a familiar place name
2019:|Reggie_Luthier looks around the place and the rather cool welcome he received here. He then thinks about his nearly empty coin pouch. He stands and goes back to the stage.
2019:|Father_Branan nods towards the bard symbolising his interesting in travelling in that direction
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Hey, friend. I'll go. This place isn't turning out to be that great for me anyway.
2019:|Ray thinks to herself {Why not, I don't have anything more important to do}
2019:|Silternius gets up and slowly walks over to join the others. "As will I, I have been meaning to travel that way anyways"
2019:|Syvis silently gets up from the chair and walks towards the bard
2019:|Ray gets up and goes towards the bard "I'm interested in joining this quest"
2019:|Syvis drinks the last bit of her wine and puts the bottle back on the bar
2019:|Reggie_Luthier chugs the last of his wine in one go.
2019:~Father_Branan: i am looking for a place in the blackfeather, if i may travel with you, though im unarmoured, id appreciate to help
2019:|Reggie_Luthier eyes the cleric and shrugs.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: No problem, friend. I know that particular kitty. Met him a while back.
2019:|Silternius nods and looks at his new travelling companions. "Let us go, then."
2019:|Father_Branan puts the newspaper rag down 'So this prince...' he points to the article '... sounds like a horrible thing happened'
2019:|Reggie_Luthier heads toward the door.
2019:|Syvis nods and waits for the other people to lead the way
2019:|Father_Branan picks up his pack of supplies and places them on his back, leaving the newspaper on the bar
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Oh yea, terrible. Really bad.
2019:~Father_Branan: i'm not familiar with this land, my first time so i am very sorry for your loss
2019:|Silternius nods slowly "I was at his funeral, it was a sad day"
2019:|Ray shrugs hearing the stranger and follows him {Finally some adventure}
2019:|Father_Branan looks downwards, awkwardly 'i, am so very sorry'
2019:|Silternius points at Sylvis "as were you, friend, if my memory serves me right"
2019:|Father_Branan looks upwards at the bright sky
2019:|Father_Branan squints, covering his face from the overwhelming light
2019:|Reggie_Luthier begins strumming a song. The song is quite refreshing and invigorating.
2019:~Silternius the Vindicator: I'm afraid my knowledge of these lands are still minimal, I travel mostly through alternative means and are not familiar with the roads. Does anyone else here know how to get there?
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Oh yea, I walk ALL the time.
2019:|Father_Branan rolls out a map, 'well i picked this up in Arrr, it looks to be somewhere south of here'
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Just go south and follow the road.
2019:|Silternius smiles "Perfect! Lead the way then, friend"
2019:|Father_Branan nods 'ah, looks like we have a guide'
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: This way
2019:|Silternius looks at the map. "excellent, let us go"
2019:|Father_Branan 's face is invigatored by the overwhelming ease of the speed that he is travelling
2019:|Father_Branan scowls towards the undead 'Enruel, give me strength to stay on our quest and not slay these abominations right now'
2019:~Father_Branan: eugh thats quite heavy rain
2019:|Reggie_Luthier quickly puts away his lute now that it is raining. He pulls out a flute instead.
2019:~Father_Branan: we should use the forest as ocver
2019:|Father_Branan lets loose a sigh of relief at the sight of the deep dark forest, 'Enruel, we have made it, soon we will find that which you seek'
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Oh hey there Chief!
2019:|Father_Branan looks over at the polar bear so far from the tundra 'Odd'
2019:|One_Eye rumbles and says in orcish, "Greetings"
2019:|Father_Branan looks shocked as it speaks
2019:|One_Eye is holding a thick parchment in his hands and seems to be trying to understand it.
2019:|Ray frowns not understanding the language
2019:~Father_Branan: a town!
2019:|Father_Branan looks nervously at the guard 'Can we just go in?'
2019:|Syvis looks at the town and nods
2019:|Father_Branan notes the tavern 'Ah great, remind me to go there in a moment'
2019:~Father_Branan: bind my soul please, kind soulbinder
2019:|Ray looks around the city
2019:|Father_Branan speaks to the guard, asking directions to Juco
2019:|Father_Branan smiles at the overseer, warmly
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Hello friend, it has been a long while.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Reinforcements?
2019:|Father_Branan starts eating a yoghurt as he leans on the banister
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Uh, that sounds ... sort of dangerous...
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: I can help with morale. The rest though....
2019:|Reggie_Luthier nods in a way that says, "duh"
2019:|Father_Branan raises an eyebrow at the idea of undead
2019:~Father_Branan: Did you say undead?
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: What you mean, undead? Didn't that get taken care of when that Arch Lich fellow was killed. Errr, rekilled?
2019:|Father_Branan puts his spoon down into his yoghurt
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: If you can arrange free room and board, oh AND booze, at the local tavern? I'm in.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: For, let's say, three weeks.
2019:~Syvis the Vanquisher: ((was silt killing the undead on the way ic or ooc ?
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: And I want some stage time there too.
2019:|Ray thinks hearing the bard {yeah, we should choose a reward}
2019:~Father_Branan: If you seek to exorcise the dead, Enruel will gladly offer his aid
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Yea, I don't really think the undead would be appreciative of my spectacular singing voice.
2019:~Father_Branan: perhaps it has drawn them out of their grave
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: My vocal cords are worth more than the gross domestic product of some nations I could name.
2019:|Reggie_Luthier sighs. "There is always another task."
2019:~Father_Branan: Of course I am not much of a fighter, but undead I can aid with - however I have been sent here for a purpose, I may need something in exchange
2019:|Father_Branan looks baffled 'That sounds... exotic'
2019:~JfL_Wng: Hey
2019:~Ray: they're the builders xD
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Oh yea, those green slimey fellows?
2019:~Ray: ))
2019:~Syvis the Vanquisher: ((again lol
2019:|Father_Branan looks confused 'What is a bullywug, if i may ask?'
2019:|Reggie_Luthier smiles. "Oh yea, that sounds like a much better idea than going out and fighting undead."
2019:|Ray just hears them speaking and looks in silence
2019:|Syvis smiles ''They are adorable amphibious people.''
2019:~Duradae_Olath: secruity?
2019:|Father_Branan looks outside into the thick darkness 'Yes i hear crows are quite common here'
2019:~Duradae_Olath: security?
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Well, off we go, shall we?
2019:~Syvis the Vanquisher: ((i do have to go in like 45 minutes
2019:|Father_Branan asks for a moment
2019:~Duradae_Olath: aski
2019:|Father_Branan enruel give us strength in our convictions
2019:|Reggie_Luthier looks at the group with a mighty grin, strips off his clothes and jumps in
2019:|Silternius ties his cloak around himself and follows suit
2019:|Ray uses her illusion to float over the lake
2019:|Father_Branan squints 'Is that a frog'
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: So this is the place.
2019:|Silternius looks around, "hmmm, I wonder who their leader is"
2019:|Reggie_Luthier puts his clothes back on.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: I don't know. Probably in the biggest hut.
2019:|Father_Branan looks confused as he sneaks past
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Hey friend. Where can we find your leader?
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Oh, hello there.
2019:|Syvis walks straight to the leader knowing the way in this town
2019:|Ray sighs "I should really learn more languages"
2019:~Silternius the Vindicator: He welcomes us and asks why we're here
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Glad you asked friend.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: The Anushi down there in Ezro? They are in a tight spot.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: They need your help. The undead, you know.
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: With the death of their prince they are worried they will lose the fight against the undead.
2019:|Father_Branan nods 'The Gods favour those that rid the lands of that which should remain at rest'
2019:|Ray casts a spell to make the bullywug more friendly
2019:~Duradae_Olath: bank
2019:~Ray: is there a linguist here?))
2019:|Syvis smiles at the Bullywug leader ''Because then you could end all of these problems.''
2019:|Ray frowns not understanding anything, turns towards the nearest person and says "I'm going to look around"
2019:|Father_Branan nods
2019:|Reggie_Luthier nods in agreement. "Yea, Undead don't really go away unless you find the cause."
2019:~Ray: wait a second))
2019:~Ray: ugh))
2019:|Father_Branan looks on, not understanding the response of the frog but understanding but tries anyway
2019:|Father_Branan says 'the undead are unlike any race, I have seen what they do to lands, look only at the deserts and the ruins of what once was there, now all there is is death and a glimer of hope in an oasis of otherwise deathly quiet sands'
2019:~Father_Branan: dont let this happen to your spawn
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: That doesn't sound good. Not at all.
2019:|Father_Branan nods, not understanding a word of the frog but seeming to pull off that he does
2019:|Reggie_Luthier grins. "You won't regret it mister Froggy."
2019:|Silternius smiles "He agrees, he'll send help"
2019:|Ray returns sighing {Why no bullywug here speaks meroei}
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: So, time to head back to Juco?
2019:|Ray looks at the bard "so what happened?"
2019:|Father_Branan shrugs, i will look around town real quick
2019:~Reggie_Luthier the Companion: Oh, we asked him to send help to Ezro. It took a bit of doing, but he agreed.
2019:|Silternius nods and smiles "Thank you friend, we must all work together to ensure these lands remain free from darkness. I will see to it personally that this assistance is not squandered
