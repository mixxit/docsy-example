**Description**

Warriors are a pure melee-based, plate-wearing tank class. They are found at the frontlines of battle, going toe-to-toe with their enemies while other party members contribute without suffering enemy wrath. 

**Newbie Guide**

Typically mercenaries or the main force of a land army due to their low expense
