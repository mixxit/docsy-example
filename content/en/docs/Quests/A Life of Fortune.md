Soandso says 'hello'

Jelran Ironbeard says 'Another mountain kin here to claim their fortune? Well I guess we better get to business. I am Embassador Ironbeard, it is my duty to see to all applicants for the Great City of Morheim are given suitable work in exchange for [citizenship] in the Keladun Kingdom'

Soandso says 'citizenship'

Jelran Ironbeard says 'Citizenship papers must be formally completed and handed to the Foreign Embassy at Morheim. We currently have vacancies in the Civil Services Office which is headed by Grumpa Greyforge. I suggest you take this notice of assignment to him at [Morheim]. Should he find you suitable for work he will hand you your citizenship papers which you can deliver to the Foreign Embassy to complete your application'

Jelran Ironbeard says 'Morheim is the grand capital of the Keladun that spans not only the highest mountain in the region but deep underground. It is a central hub of trade for Qylia, many foreigners far and wide come to visit us. The road here will lead you to Morheim but beware there have been reports of Wild Worgs roaming the roads'

Should you complete the work return to me with a Token of Appreciation and I will see that your citizenship papers are completed'

Soandso says 'I'm from the civil service'

Trambl Deeppockets says 'About damn time! We lost half our crops to those little green terrors! They came in the middle of the night and started digging up the fields! I think they are looking for something! Do something about it and bring me a head so I can stick it on a spike! That should make them think twice!'
