The Poem of Taliesin
 
I was nine full months
 
In the womb of Shai.
 
Before that I was Methabeht,
 
But now I am Taliesin.
 
I was with my king
 
In the heavens
 
When Ferrelux fell
 
Into the deepest hell.
 
I carried the banner
 
Before the Rokr.
 
I know the names of the stars
 
From the North to the South.
 
I was in Caer Bedion
 
Xenophon.
 
I accompanied the Weaver
 
With the soul of Ghufran
 
I was the flaming arrow
 
When Akakios was slain.
 
I was in Llys Don
 
Before the birth of Adelita.
 
I was patriarch
 
To Leonidas and Enoch.
 
I was there at the destruction
 
Of the peaceful Eusean.
 
I was the foreman
 
At the construction of the Tower.
 
I was three times
 
In the prison of Zuriel.
 
I was in the citadel
 
With Shana and Alpha
 
I witnessed the destruction
 
Of all of Esoron.
 
I was a unswerving shield
 
To Oboron of Azura.
 
I have gone hungry
 
For the only One.
 
I was at the White Mount
 
in the court of Tarakan.
 
In stocks and in fetters
 
For a year and a day.
 
I was instructor
 
To the whole universe.
 
I shall be until the judgement
 
On the face of the earth.
 
I have sat in the perilous seat
 
Above Caer Sidi.
 
I shall continue to revolve
 
Between the three elements.
 
There is a marvel in the world
 
Which I cannot reveal.
