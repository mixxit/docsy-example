Power among the Gods trickle downwards from their source, The Unknown. Power is also augmented by number of worshippers. Killing a god of higher status significantly weakens the lesser gods. Balance must always be maintained

# The Unknown

It is said in the beginning there was nothing but a vast endless sea of unbroken darkness in which a god as ageless as time swam, lighting its way with vast jewel like suns. On its journey the god did stumble upon the barren landscape of a now dead star. Lying upon its center it did see a bright blue lake of incredible beauty glistening with astral magic of the wisps that flickered above it. Curious to the nature of this outside influence of his domain the God broke a part of itself and elevated the wisps to a pantheon of primordial entities that would watch over the world in his stead as he continued his journey through the stars

Very few if any races are aware of this God. This pantheon draws its power from no where

# The Primordials

Over time the primordials transformed the energies of the long dead star into vast blue oceans, ever growing lush vegetation and towering mountain peaks.

Pleased with the near perfect order and testimony to the will of their creator the gods now planned their much needed rest. To ensure the world could be watched over in their slumber they fused their being into one and formed a god of great power to watch over the world and ensure balance would always be maintained until the great day their god would return from his journey through the heavens

Very few if any races are aware of these forces. This pantheon draws its power from The Unknown
