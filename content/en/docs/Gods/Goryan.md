Goryan
{{% /pageinfo %}}
Goryan the Dream Maker rules over the Plane of Dreams and is mostly depicted in the apperance of a Garuda  He is often seen or associated with Zurvan when he delivers prophecies in the form of visions to ones deemed fit to see the nature of all things  Goryan is the counter opposite to Xetizel, the God of Nightmares, a dark crow like figure which prays upon those not strong enough to walk through the dream plane  It is believed by those who worship Goryan that Solinia was destroyed during the catastrophic events of Kumari and we have long since been severed from true reality, living only in the final dream played out by the Dreammaker
