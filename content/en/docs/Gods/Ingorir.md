Ingorir is the God of Fire, lover of Lunarine and father of Deuzulus

# Caerthain Origins

Ingorir began life as a humble priest to Sol'Azul and spent much of his life providing religious rites for the royal and high ranking members of the Caerthain Empire

For some reason or another, Lunarine looked upon him favouribly and chose to position him so that he could be elevated to the new Elemental Pantheon as the God of Fire, taking the place of Sol'Azul

The union of of Ingorir and Lunarine resulted in the birth of Deuzulus, the eventual God of Hate
