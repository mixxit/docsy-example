Somnus the Shaderider is the God of Shade and Darkness and rules over the Plane of Shade. It is believed Somnus was the lover of Zephyr and her death plunged him into an enormous depression.  Some say that Somnus gifted the Mysmaal Vampirism because of the death of Zephyr but none know of the true reason  This god is often attributed as the main deity of the Mysmaal  Somnus fell into deep depression after the death of Zephyr - he despises the Oshira to this death for their involvement  Somnus gifted the Mysmaal with Vampirism in the Lost Age
