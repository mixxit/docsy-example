Emperor Elaril Val'Elsir

Ruler of the [Caerthian Empire](https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/races/caerthian/) during the Mythological Age and the Time of Crisis, Emperor Elaril Val'Elsir is a pure blood Sun Elf of the lands of [Qylia](https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/locations/qylia/). He oversaw a bitter rivalry with the Aerindal Kindgdoms of the North, invading them twice during his leadership

# Noteable Campaigns

## The War of the Four Kingdoms

It is believed Val'Elsir oversaw a propagander campaign forcing the Ophidians to invade Caerthain territory as a justification for Caerthian evacuation and expansion north into Aerindal territory. Paying the Ogres a large sum to invade the Keladun and Aerindal whilst simultaneously blaming brutalities on caerthian refugees the Caerthians began a war into the lands of Aerindal and conquered the city of Eindel

It was during this period that the Aerindal drifted into the pages of history, had it not been for the return of future travellers into the past, the Aerindal would never have been seen again

## The Caerthian Invasion of Amaria

Emperor Val'Elsir was murdered by the lich Shai'Din in the final moments of the Eindel siege during The Caerthian Invasion of Amaria in 1234 P-OE (196982 UT)

# Family Name

Val'Elsir is believed to be a word that represents the city of [Cal'Drin](https://www.fallofanempire.com/docs/locations/qylia/caldrin/) and was discovered by the Caerthians in the subterranean areas of the appropriated city. The dynastic name was first taken by Emperor Galamar Ra'Ern and stayed in the family until Prince Envar Val'Elsir who reverted the suranme back to Ra'Ern

The name (and in particular the throne) was also adopted by the earliest dynasties of the Mysmaal many years after the fall of the Caerthian Empire
