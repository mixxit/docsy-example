Sigurd
{{% /pageinfo %}}
Sigurd is a mythological warrior spoken of in many texts of the western hemisphere and is spoken of in his odyssey as travelling the four corners of the world completing several tasks for the ancient dieties. One of these tasks is known to have rewarded sigurd with the Aegis, a powerful shield that allowed him to defeat incredible creatures.  What baffles the scholars most about Sigurd is his race as he appears to be almost similar to the modern human race but they could not have existed during that time. It is perhaps some other similar race from ancient times that has been lost to the ages.  The search for sigurd has been the life long work of many geneologists attempting to uncover more history of their own race in the time before the cataclysm.  It is known that recently Sigurd returned with the arrival of Python on the island of Kumari - how this was achieved is unknown
