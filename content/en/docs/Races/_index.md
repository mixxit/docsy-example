Races

# Overview

There are currently over 40 defined races in game, of which we have currently locked down to 12 selected at player creation. Over time these races vary, and we sometimes have granted players access to a race not publically available to all.

Each race has their own unique statistics and background, it also affects which classes you can use, for example the  less intelligent races generally cant use magic

There have been many races over the 100,000 years of Solinias lifetime, some are descended from each other and others are completely unique. This is particularly common in the human/elf like races of Solinia who are generally descended from two main branches - Kelderan and Dal
