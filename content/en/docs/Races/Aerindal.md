It is said that among the Sky Elves of Qylia was born a young elf named Zephyr who would achieve godhood at the cost of her people. The Aerindal have since become a mythical race of legend  The Aerindal are one of the original 4 bipedal human-like races that are descended directly from the Dal (Similar to their Caerthian cousins). They are contempary with the Valderain, Keladun and Caerthians and existed in many ages past.  Due to the investigation of the Dark Elves into the origins of the Mysmaal, some races of the future returned to the past and attempted to alter the direction of the original races which has had some unintended consequences on the timeline (eventually leading to the events of the Time Crisis)

### History

#### The Original Timeline

The Aerindal are Sky Elves that are cousins to the Caerthians. Though not enemies, there was much distrust and rivalry between the Caerthians and Aerindal and they rarely intermixed. The Aerindal eventually died out and no more races were were descended from them, however, their close relationship with the Valderain resulted in some offspring that carred the eventual bloodline to the Vishim race who can pretty much be considered the modern day Aerindal.

The Aerindal Kingdom sat on the north of the desert border in the forests and plains on Qylia. The Aerindal built tall majestic structures in honour of the Gods of the Sky (Primarily: Aer'Aral). There was a strong bonded alliance between the Aerindal and human-like Valderain who inhabited the islands in the nearby seas. There was also a strong trade pact with the Keladun dwarves, with the Aerindal acting as intermediaries for trade with the Valderain.

The Aerindal were exceptional builders, rivaling the extravagance of the Caerthians with glorious gleaming structures spread all over the various areas of the Aerindal Kingdom  The main threat for the Aerindal were the Ogres who invaded from the northern borders of their city, the Aerindal being skilled elven fighters rarely suffer casualities unless the Ogres managed to collectively attack as a large war band.

The Aerindal capital was a vast open city surrounded by an beautifully crafted and engraved walls. Its palace layed at its center and soured high into the sky as a symbol of their devotion to the Sky. 

#### The Goddess Zephyrs Origins and the altering of Aerindal destiny

During the last days of the Aerindal, a young girl named Zephyr journeyed with some heroes to a place at the very top of the world known as the Anchor. It was here that she met with the last the female Dal named Solinia. It is said that during her time here, she and others of the party, were elevated to rule as the Elemental Pantheon. Over time, the treachery of Daezulus and the Oshira resulted in Zephyrs murder and the weakening of the Elemental Pantheon.

It was not till thousand of years later a young woman named Natalie managed to find a way to travel back in time and prevent Zephyr from joining the elemental pantheon. She then brought back Zephyr to modern era to aid with the Caerthian attack on the Aerindals, saving them from their destiny of destruction at the hands of the Caerthians, Oshira and Hiran Asura. 

Zephyr almost lost her life a second time in her battle with Hiran, but was saved by the return of Solinia who removed Hiran Asuras curse and gave the Aerindal enough time to flee on a vessel to the Severed Isles far in the north of Solinia.
