## Playable Race

This is currently a playable race

# Origins

The Tinai were one of the oldest races, created to be messengers of the god Methabeht. As they are individually created, individuals can vary much more greatly than is usual for a species

It is thought that the original ancestral lands of the Tinai is Esoron as spoken in several tales such as the Poem of Taliesin

# The Fall of the Angels

The Angels are the oldest of the races, thus having a long history. Their civilization spanned all of Solinia for a long time, their floating cities, which they built because they did not want to disturb Solinia’s nature, dominating the sky with their grace. However, this all ended when a Tinai named Hiran Asura succumbed to the temptations of The Weaver. He had lost his brother to another Angel, also tempted by the Weaver. She promised him that through the destruction of the lesser gods he could absorb their power and gain access to planar abilities far greater than his rival could ever imagine and when his task was complete and his enemy defeated he would hold such dominion over the very forces of the universe he could bring back his lost brother and restore the life he had once known.

Corrupted by his hatred and despair at defeat Hiran Asura handed his life over to the Weaver and his destruction of the Gods that once walked on the lands of Solinia began. The World was devastated during his battles with the gods and the innocent younger races were permanently erased at the hands of Hiran. Some races fled to The Under and others, such as the Tinai, who fought valiantly but eventually were forced to flee as well. An entire pantheon of Gods were slain by Hiran Asura and the power he began to contain erased nearly all of the man he had once been.

Angel society is based around each and every one individual agreeing on a course of action they all undertake together. At their civilizational apex, Angels lived in giant floating cities held up in the sky by the grace of the gods, living in perfect harmony with each other. However, these times lie in the far off past, and are not remembered by anyone except the Angels themselves. Nowadays, due to being few and spread very thinly across the land, they act more individualistically, following their own high moral standards. They have never had any ruling body, although at times, an especially charismatic Angel may sway the population to follow him in his decisions. However, they never consider themselves to be obliged to this one person, who they don’t consider their ruler, but more of an equal whom they all can agree with. In this way, the Angels have always governed themselves, while also keeping the good of others in the back of their minds with every action.

## Biology and appearance

The Tinai have the basic appearence of humanoids with large feathered wings. Their skin can be of any shade familiar to humans, as well as more unusual colours such as pearly blues, creamy whites and even fiery orange-brown. Their wings are often in a colour that contrasts their skin tone, but is limited to colours found in bird wings- not that this is much of a limit, with birds displaying a huge variety of colours from the bright orange plumage of a hoatzin to the duller, motled browns of a hawk. Their wing shape and size also varies between individuals; with long, narrow wings allowing long-distance flight and shorter, rounder wings more appropriate for quick maneuvering between trees.
Naming theme

The first names of the Tinai often end in -iel -ael or -on, they are often very "round" sounding, commonly using ph, z, a, s and m. Think typical "angel" names.

Their second names often describe their deeds and traits rather than their family history- they do not have lineages.

Tinai live forever but can reproduce in rare occasions that love overwhelms their desire for duty and service to their God
