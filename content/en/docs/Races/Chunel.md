# Historical Heroes

The most famous hero of the Chuenl is the once-slave girl Eshu who insited a rebellion against the Oshira slavemasters freeing the Gialon and Chunel in the process

Eshu is known to have carried a shard of the Blade of Ashri during this campaign which is carried by the chief of the leading tribe to this day. The Blade was recovered from the heart of the entombed Mysmaal King which gave her the strength to lead the rebellion

They operate in tribes much as they did on their homelands and worship Sethris the Stalker, God of Balance but are also known to worship various animal spirits of the spirit realm and other war like Gods
