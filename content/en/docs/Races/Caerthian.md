Sun Elves from the lands of Qylia. Highly militaristic and fervent worshippers of Sol'Azul

# History

The Caerthians were descendents of the the pure elves (Dal). They were a neutral race of the Age of Defiance/Mythological Age that innevitably became the Mysmaal. They worship the Sun, which they refer to as Sol'Azul.

Their kingdom stretched across the southern deserts where they were sharing a northern border with their sister race the Aerindal and the Ophidia (their enemies) to the jungles of east. They had a truce with the Aerindal and rarely engaged in relations with them, you might say it pleased them when the Aerindal suffer some unfortunate fate.

The Caerthians had some relations with the Keladun and Valderain but it was mainly a trade relationship and always had come to the Caerthians with their offer. 

They were exquisite builders, unrivaled fighters and only really suffering against the ophidia due to the sheer amount of numbers they had.

During the Age of Defiance the Caerthians manipulated the many factions of Qylia to initate a war known as the War of the Four Kingdoms which saw the rise of the Caerthian Empire and the final destruction of the Aerindal
