# Origins

The earliest human records of Undead speak of an endless invasion on the continetn of Asgarad against the walls of Ravenholme. But wherever you travel on Solinia you are likely to find Undead everywhere. After years of study by necromancers of all races it seems that Undead are living beings that have failed, for whatever reason, to make it successfully into The Maw 

## Culture

They are generally solitary but can be found in groups without leadership. There have been some cases however where undead have been under the control of other undead. More specifically two events would be the King Draugr, an ancient King brought back to life by a Necromancer who was consequently beheaded and thrown to the now Undead Kings Hordes. The other would be the Lich of the Karnon who is sometimes said to roam the planes of Halcron, believed to been a Necromancer who attempted to make himself immortal and instead doomed himself to a life of mindless undeath. 

## Biology and appearance

Generally a decayed version of their former selves, though some are completely bone
