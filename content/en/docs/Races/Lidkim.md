# Basic information

# History

The Lizardmen can trace their roots to the Acacia. Something unusual happened on this island many thousands of years ago that raised the entire western portion of the land and scorched the once wild forests that covered it. During this time, the Lidkim speak of a curse that tainted their kin and transformed them into cannibals resulting in the the total annihilation of their capital, Chelthix.

Fortunately for the remaining Lidkim; the Vishim, who had recently arrived on Acacia, formed a partial alliance with in agreement for land on the eastern shore.

The Vishim soon established the city of Braemar and eventually the fort of Fiongate that some Lidkim used as temporary housing whilst trying to recover Chelthix before their efforts have so far failed due to the inhabiting Zunak.

Because of relations with the Vishim, some Lidkim have travelled far across the world, including to Tsiyon where a handful signed up to join the Element 5 Expeditionary Force. During this time the lidkim were an essential part of the founding of the Kingdoms of New Meropis.

The Lidkim believe themselves to be very ancient, existing long before the other races took their modern forms. They believe they were "uplifed" by the gods to their current sentient state, but lived in a primative society. They look upon the younger races as spritely and ingenious, admiring the Morannon and Humans for their technology and adapting it to their own use.

They share their language with the Tailless, hinting at a relationship between the Lidkim and the ancient Dragons. 

# Culture

Despite their somewhat menacing appearence, Lidkim are friendly and happy to welcome others into their homes. They have very strong friendships and are keen to assist others in times of need. They are loyal and trusting, sometimes too trusting and as such find it difficult understanding and working with more untrustworthy races.

Even though they are generally peaceful, if their family or allies are threatened they will draw their blades to defend without hesitation.

Lidkim are social creatures, creating bustling towns near rivers and lakes. Harnessing the power of the water; dams, watermills, boats and canals are all a typical feature of Lidkim settlements. Despite their love of fresh water, they do not take well to the oceans as they find salt water repulsive. They integrate well with other races and are friendly and open to trade.

Lidkim tend to live in family groups and are caring parents who tend to their eggs and young long after hatching. They prefer warm environments, but cope in colder climates by wrapping up warm and creating more insulating houses. They find the practise of raising livestock for food and materials barbaric, and as such their clothing is made of cottons and metal; rarely leather. 

# Biology and Apperance

The Lidkim are an unusual race with features of both mammals and reptiles. Standing a little shorter than the average human, they have long muscular tails with a crest which is used for swimming, as well as webbed hind feet and dexterous hands. They are covered in smooth scaleless skin sometimes sporting bristles and hairs. They come in a range of mottled browns, oranges and greens with males sporting brighter coloured markings and more pronounced frills and quills.

Semi-aquatic, their traditional home is within swamps but are now more often found in settlements alongside rivers or lakes. Lidkim are omnivorous; their diet consists mainly of fish, squid, aquatic weeds and plants.

Lidkim hatch from eggs, with clutches of up to 6. They hatch quickly after about a month and are able to walk and begin talking and learning immediately. For a number of years after hatching the young Lidkim, known as babbers, still need protection by their parents. 

# Naming themes

Lidkim first names tend to take two forms; single words and double-barrelled. They often use double vowels ee, ii and aa, are heavy on K, J and D as well as more "hissing" noises; Z, S, Ch and Sh.

Last names follow the same naming rules as first names, often ending with -ius and -thia. Lidkim last names represent the "family" or household they belong to and do not represent relation, as unrelated Lidkim who join a household or clan take on the same last name.
