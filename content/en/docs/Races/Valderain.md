# Introduction

The Valderain are a human like race from the Mythological Age that worship the Oceans. They built large paradises cities on islands throughout the seas of Qylia. They were naturally seafaring, heavily orientated on trade and had many sub settlements and trade towns across the continents. 

It is not uncommon for small Valderain villages to have sprung up completely out at sea from the remnents of wrecks of boats and small outcroppings of rocks

Valderain had an extremely close alliance with the Aerindal which had resulted in many of the major races of the future existing. 

The Valderain capital city was vast, the largest Harbour of any of the races of its time, massive defensive walls surrounded their city far out into the sea, due to their lack of natural resources their entire city relied on the constant arrival of new goods coming and going through their many boats out at sea

The Valderain due to their expansionism, ingenuity and growing population were very rich, had many settlemens in every area of the land and were fast to adapt to changing circumstances, it is due to this the Aerindal and Keladun appreciated the Valderains aid in wars against the Ogres and Gobel

The Valderain Capital being at sea was naturally safe from outsiders, the Valderain Fleet was unrivalled and there was no piracy in their waters but there were however certain underground groups within the population that operated a black market and fencing network across the Valderain Empire that the Royalty had struggled to squash out
