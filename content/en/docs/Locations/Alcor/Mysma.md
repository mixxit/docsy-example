Mysma is a common name used to identify capital cities of mysmaal dynasties  Mysma - The Dynasty of Taon (House Vex)  Mysma - The Dynasty of Alcor (House V'Mar)  Mysma - The Dynasty of Angel Isles (?)  Scholars have discussed the possibility of the origins of the name Mysmaal and have come to the conclusion that although the Mysmaal base their origins in Taon, it was not until the Tower of Mysma was discovered on Alcor that the race began to identify themselves as Mysmaal
