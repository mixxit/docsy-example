Home to a number of mythological creatures such as centaurs and rare birds. It is a place of nature and growth and some believe blessed by forgotten gods. However there are no civilisations here as such except the city of Meropis which lies to the far north.\
**Transport Links**  The only means of entering and leaving this area is through a tunnel that leads directly to the swampland of Scheria. This is heavily guarded by the centaurs who take great pride in their holy land.\
**Locations of Interest**  The Everliving Flower  The entrance to Meropis\
**Threats**  All life here is relatively peaceful unless you are found to be tainting or desecrating their holy land.\
**History**  This land and it's inhabitants are believed to outdate even the ancient city of Euesebes. The Meropii who live here left eusebes to find a home among the positive life forces of the continent. Over time the village of Meropis grew into the gigantic white stoned citadel it is today and it dedicates itself to peace and growth and has held off many invasions from the Kandam Empire thanks to a shaky alliance with the local centaurs.
