The Library of V'Lorn is a vast underground complex of libraries maintained by High Archivist Raan N'Var in the dark elven city of Undergate

The Library of V'Lorn towers high into the subterranean city of Undergate and is filled with all manners of tomes, artifacts and lost treasures. It is thanks to Raan's careful management that the Library continues on as an important location of Dark Elven wisdom
