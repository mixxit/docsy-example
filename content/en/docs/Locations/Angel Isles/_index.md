Angel Isles
{{% /pageinfo %}}
The Angel Isles are a set of lands in the south of Solinia inhabited by Mysmaal and Orc  It was in the recent era that the Mysmaal assisted the escaped Meroei, Corrupt Vishim and Nijin from the Dead lands of The Jungle  The odd weather patterns and location of the islands allow the varying climates but most of the area is covered in unihabited frozen tundra where the ruins of Balrud lay  It is believed the Angel Isles got their name from the Tinai as there lays an ancient lost Tinai Temple at the junction point between several of the islands
