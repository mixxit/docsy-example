{{% /pageinfo %}}
Built into the cliffs of the Winters Deep far north of the Deepfrost plains on the continent of Asgarad  Tracing the Vishim / Elvish history will lead you to this place - once home to all elvish races before the time of the great spreading - this place was finally left to rest before the elvish races moved into Ravenholme  Many Vishim and Elves travel here to pay homage to their forefathers
