Southern Wastes

All along the wind battered Barren Coast that stretches from West to East lays the frigid Southern Wastes. An unforgiving tundra of ice and snow that is home to Sirens and Goblins. 

If the cold doesnt kill the travellers making their way through this land, then they will surely end up as play things of the Sirens in the Palace of Frozen songs. Weary travellers caught sailing past this land will hear the gentle song calling them towards the gleaming lights that sparkle in the distance, unknowning the dangers that wait them if they manage to safely land on its shores

Along the west side of the Wastes is the Goblin Kingdom of Sraal, an ever expanding race of blue Gobel who have emerged from the Dragonspine Mountains intent on claiming territory on the surface. They feast on the animals and creatures that wander, lost, from the Vale of Zhuvirae to the north and have recently set their sights on lands claimed by the Orcs

To the far East you will find the most recent arrivals to the Wastes. The Asurans have constructed an impenetrable fortress known as the Summit of the Fallen, some believe it is a temple to gods long lost, others an outpost for something much bigger to come
