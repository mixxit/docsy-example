Summit of the Fallen
{{% /pageinfo %}}

The most recenty arrivals of the Wastes are the illusive Shattered Wing arm of the Asurans. They have constructed an impenetrable 
fort in the wastes not far south from the Fading Wilds. It currently unclear what the purpose of the Asurans are. Some believe the
summit is holy place, dedicated to their God, Hiran Asura. Others are not so certain.

The House of the Shattered Wing is currently led by Az'zealeif who makes his home in the summit. It appears he has been particularly
interesting in monitoring the progress of the recent survivors that crash landed on the southern coasts of the Blackfeather Plains.

Only time will tell what the purpose of the Asurans are on the Island and why they are so interested in those that have arrived but
few believe that it will be benevolent
