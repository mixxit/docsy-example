Steppes of the Stormking

The wide open wilderness of the eastern lands of Avaris sits at the foot of the mountains of the holy sanctuary of Elysia

This land is home to Storm Giants, and the bones of many dead dragons that fell in the war with the avarians

Among the craggy open steppes are the wildlife that make up the staple of the Storm Giants diet, and on occasion a exploring band of orcs or newly arrived meroei hoping to find riches in the hills

The Storm King sits on his throne in Storm Keep at the hills of the nearby mountains, he is an unforgiving war loving champion that has not seen a good battle since the days the last of the dragons fled the land

The giants respect the holy nature of the elysian caldera that lays beyond the mountains, they understand what happens should they disrepect the gods. They are more than happy to protect the entrance to the valley and act as bouncers killing anyone who dare approach
