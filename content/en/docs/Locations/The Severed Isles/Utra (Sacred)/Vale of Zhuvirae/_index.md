Vale of Zhuvirae

It is written that in ages past the Gods did walk upon Solinia like the mortals of today. It is here, in the center of the land of Utra, that Zhuvirae found beauty in the untouched ancient forests and lakes that shimmered in her ever watching moon light. 

Laying in the center of a circular mountain range and at the foot of the Dragonspine mountains, the Vale sits comfortably protected on almost all her sides. It is on the mountain range to the far west that we find Castle Blackveil, settled decades before the arrival of the Orcs and Anushi that now dominate most of Utra. The people of the Vale know to stay clear of its walls as any that have entered their territory have never returned.

Travellers through this land will see the touch of ancient gods of nature as the fairies and nymphs of the Kingdom of Rustcap play happily and mischievously in the deepest and most ancient parts of the forest. Ever guarding the forest from those that would seek to take from her, the Rustcap people are untrusting of outsiders, particularly the Orcs to the east and Avarians and Giants to the west that are constantly encroaching on their home.

It is believed that deep below the land of Zhuvirae lays a great source of magical energy, which sustains the life of the fairy people that live extremely long lives in the Vale, but sadly, the horrors that lay below the forest are a perfect counter balance to the beauty you will see on its surface.
