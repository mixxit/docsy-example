Tanqara is a beautiful sandstone trade city set within a central ravine in the Sleeping Sands

It is ruled by the Crusader King Veran Shar and was founded in the year 197084 UT following the Anushi's departure from Ambreka 

The city has a permanent collection of viziers that are responsible for various areas that allow the city to operate. These generally range from trade to defense to the spiritual. The city shares different cultures including anushi, lidkim, xunshi and even orcs. Due to this it has many different faiths and a mixed set of languages.

Tanqara would not be able to operate without the trade that flows from ARRR, Lunathis and beyond. The growing population has been an issue recently and a town named Ezro was created in the Blackfeather to alleviate some of this

Sadly the recent tensions with Ezro and the Kenku resulted in the death of Prince Kaeden and now war is brewing between Tanqara and the kenku city of Zerzura
