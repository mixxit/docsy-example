The Fading Wilds

The fading forest to the south of the steppes is home to those that have been banished from the Valley of Elysia

This browning dying woodland is home to all manner of natures strangest creations from mutated satyr, decaying myconids, rotting undead and viscious acid filled plant life that is unforgiving to any

If you do make it deep into to the forest then you are likely to end up wrapped in the cacoons of the fading spiders smother the forest in cobwebs, slowly digesting the remnents of satyrs and giants that got tangled in there months ago

It seems some civilsation must have existed here at some point, as if you were to slash your way through the cobwebs and fettid vines you would find long forgotten golden temples, to who are what we will never know
