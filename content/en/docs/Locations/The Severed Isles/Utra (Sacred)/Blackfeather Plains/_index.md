Blackfeather Plains

Nestled at the foot of the Dragonspione Mountains the Blackfeather Plains is an endless swampy forest making home to the Kenku of Zerzura and Bullywugs of Pollywog Hollow

Recently, the Anushi of Tanqara have begun to cut a trade route through the forest and have settled in the central lake a city they have named Ezro

Through diplomacy the Ezronite traders have become friendly with the Bullywugs but are under constant threat from the Kenku who loom ever watching in the everdark canopies over head

Some speak of shambling dead that roam through the forests at night, pouring out of long lost ruins in the north, whatever is causing their unrest, is becoming more and more frequent
