Ezro

The newly founded town of Ezro is led by the Overseer Juco and the auspicious Elder Council consisting of mainly spiritualist and cultural leaders interested in building a new life in the Blackfeather whilst maintaining Anushi heritage

The original designs for the outpost were to build a trade relationship with the inhabitants of the rich mountains and wildlife of the Blackfeather in sharp contrast to the desert city of Tanqara in its unforgiving heat

The funding of the project was approved by CrusaderKing Veran Shar due to the possibility of a countinual food supply line into the city of Tanqara. The desert and its oasises were always limited in the total population it could support. The King sent his son and Overseer Juco as managers of the is new project, with the Elder Council formulated to be the spiritual heart of the new towns rulership. Hand in hand the Overseer and the Council share power, with the Overseer mainly there for logistical and day to day management reasons

Initial tensions with the Kenku began from the get go, with many caravans being destroyed in and out of the forest, however this brought with it a new alliance with the bullywugs to the east. Since that time a large portion of the north eastern side of the forest is mainly safe, save for the few undead that have recently begun rising from the ground
