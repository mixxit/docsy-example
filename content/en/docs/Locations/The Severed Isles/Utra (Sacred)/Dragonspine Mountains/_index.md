Dragonspine Mountains

The mountains mark an uncrossable barrier between the Blackfeather and Vale of Zhuvirae on the western lands of Utra. Populated mainly in its winding cavernous depths are the Goblins of Sraal and the Myconids which find warmth in the heat of the lava that sloshes like a river through the iron filled unbelly of Utra

It is believed the mountains take their name from some ancient storm dragon, the last of many that once inhabited this continent in ages past. At night, some still believe they can stlil hear the wailing of the ancient scaled one as it weeps for its long lost kin

Recently the Orcs of Redfang have begun to dig deep into the northern parts of the mountain range, led by a fanatic oracle named Lord Murag they are seeking something ancient but the mountain keeps its secrets away from the hands of mortals
