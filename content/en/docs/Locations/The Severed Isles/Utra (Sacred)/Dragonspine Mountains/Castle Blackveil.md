Castle Blackveil
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Bloodguard dungeon at -1336 68 58

This war-torn fortress is home to the renegade Bloodguards that fled New Genesis and established a militant outpost under their own self rule. After many battles with the local inhabitants and among themselves, the structure is in a state of disarray, but still strengthened by its remaining Mysmaal soldiers.
