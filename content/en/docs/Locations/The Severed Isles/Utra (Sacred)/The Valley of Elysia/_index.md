# The Valley of Elysia

It is said in the beginning there was nothing but a vast endless sea of unbroken darkness in which a god as ageless as time swam, lighting its way with vast jewel like suns. On its journey the god did stumble upon the barren landscape of a now dead star lying upon its center it did see a bright blue lake of incredible beauty glistening with astral magic of the wisps that flickered above it

It is here in the Valley of Elysia where life first emerged on Solinia. The Valley is revered even by the Gods and guarded by faithful Satyrs
