Stonebrook Tavern is a refuge for those traveling south of the city of Ambreka across Candus. The tavern is a semi-permanent home to many travelers and an extended stay home for some. Those that work there live there as permanent residents. Bards often come here to spread news and gossip for coin. Many other less desirable types also frequent the tavern due to its remote location.
