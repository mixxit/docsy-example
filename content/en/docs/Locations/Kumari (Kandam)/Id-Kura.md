Id-Kura is a legendary gate placed on the side of Mount Enlil which leads into The Under. It is told of in many creation tales that a race did pass through here to escape a coming cataclsym at the cost of the life of their ruler.  It is guarded by a behemoth that demands a sacrifice for all who enter and challenge for all who leave.
