 Arnar

The quiet city of the barbarians lives in the frigid lands of the east, plagued mainly by the weather rather than any specific creatures the Barbarians have found a peaceful life here

Only the gobel to the north and sirens to the east could pose a threat, but they never venture this far into the tundra
