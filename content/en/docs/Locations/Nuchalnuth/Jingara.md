Jingara is the home and birthplace of the Takafi  Jingara is a region of arid, dry scrubland. The hills are low and rocky, and patchy grass sprouts like mangy fur from the landscape. It is the broad, south-eastern portion of Nuchalnuth.  Jingara has, at first glance, few resources. In truth, though it lacks much in the way of water, fertile ground or sizable vegetation, there are a number of mineral veins present, with an oddly high density of metals and gems which are very useful in magic.  Verlore is located in western Jingara, near the lake. Jingara connects to the Skaranach Highlands to the north, and Green Hell to the west.
