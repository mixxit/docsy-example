Tean'Zu
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Tean'Zu is the base of operations for the brutal orc like creatures that ravage the Plains of Amurru 

Ruled over by a tyrant the these creatures pillage and burn all they cross which is a blight for the Meroei who are already struggling with Goblins and Undead 

Some say they are manipulated by others who do not wish to see the proto humans spread too far into other racial territories 

What was once forests have long since been burned and used to fuel the building of outposts 

Tean'Zu is in the western cliffs of the Plains of Amurru
